# A minimal example of how to use dotnet-grpc alongside a Asp.Net 6 Web Api inside a Docker container

This is created as a starting point for anyone who wants to use grpc-dotnet alongside a Asp.Net 6 Web Api.

Essentially this combines the [greeter example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/tree/master/examples/Greeter) with the [WebApi template](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/70c05f178a33e018ed6c29295f0df190ad44b7e5/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/WebApi-CSharp) from running `dotnet new WebApi`
